Hi there, this is just a quick test post for geefr.github.io.

I realised while I have my main site [gfrancisdev.co.uk](gfrancisdev.co.uk) it's more a place for long term portfolio things, summaries, and links, rather than more frequent tech-posting.

So here we are. Either I'll be adding various notes and info on things here, or it'll be forgotten, only time will tell.

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main(void) {
  std::cout << "Hello, Github pages!" << std::endl;
  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```
